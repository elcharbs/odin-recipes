        <p>Som Tum is a traditional Thai salad made of green papaya. Commonly served by street vendors across the country, there are a number of different ways this dish can be prepared depending on the region.</p>
        <p>This recipe is a relatively standard som tum inspired by the street vendors I frequented while living in Thailand.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <uL>
            <li>1x Green papaya</li>
            <li>2 - 3 tbsps of fish sauce</li>
            <li>3x fresh limes to juice</li>
            <li>Bird's eye chilies (as little as 0 as many as you want)</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>5-7 cherry tomatoes or 1 roma tomato</li>
            <li>1 stalk of long bean (or 3-4 green beans)</li>
            <li>2 tbsps unsalted, blanched red or white peanutes to toast</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Dried shrimp</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsps Palm sugar (white sugar will work in it's place)</li>
        </uL>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast peanuts in a heated skillet then crush them in the mortar and pestle. Set aside</li>
            <li>Peel and julienne (using the peeler) your green papaya. You'll want to have at least 2 handfuls (3 ish cups) to make the salad with. Once julienned, set the papaya aside in a bowl with cold water</li>
            <li>Juice limes</li>
            <li>Chop green beans into 6cm pieces. If using a roma tomato, chop this into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>Combine garlic and chilies in mortar and crush until a paste is formed. Depending on how hot you like it, you can add anywhere from 1 to 5 chilies (or more, you do you)</li>
            <li>Add palm sugar to mortar and crush until blended</li>
            <li>Add papaya and crush using the spoon to help move the papaya around in between. The goal here isn't to pulverize the papaya, just soften it a bit</li>
            <li>Add lime juice and fish sauce contining to mix and crush</li>
            <li>Add dried shrimp, toasted peanuts, tomatoes and beans mixing well</li>
            <li>Plate and serve with sticky rice</li>
        </ol>
